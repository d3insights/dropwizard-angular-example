# This project is under construction.  Check back soon!

This example project is loosely based on the AngularJS + Spring demo project called Pointy Patient 
(http://nayidisha.com/techblog/angular-js-from-a-different-angle and https://github.com/pankajtandon/PointyPatient).  I
have liberally modified that app to explore the aspects of AngularJS that I wanted to understand better as well as
rewrote the back-end using Dropwizard, which I find ideal for building REST back-end services for AngularJS apps.

TODO before this example is complete (roughly in order):

* Add Java unit tests
* Add JS unit tests
* Add e2e unit tests
* Implement a customer WebJars bundle so that versions need not be explicitly mentioned other than in the pom.xml
* Figure out how to serve index.html from root
* Add user management and make some operations (e.g., patient editing) require authentication
* Restrict server communication to HTTPS
* Investigate introduction of RequireJS
